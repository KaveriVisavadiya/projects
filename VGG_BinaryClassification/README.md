This folder contains files that compare the performance on a binary classification task of the following models: 

1. VGG (1 block) 
2. VGG (3 blocks)
3. VGG (3 blocks) with data augmentation
4. Transfer learning using VGG16 or VGG19 with tuning all layers (including tuning convolution layers)
5. Transfer learning using VGG16 or VGG19 with tuning only final MLP layers (excluding convolution layers)

A handmade 2-class dataset has been created for the purpose. Code has been referred from the website https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-to-classify-photos-of-dogs-and-cats/
